# Cat-on-a-Roof
The name of my project is ‘Cat on a Roof’. It involves an animated cat that continuously runs from roof to roof of a series of buildings of varying heights and sizes (that may become taller and narrower as the user’s score improves) whilst collecting fish. The user is responsible for using the Up key to control the jumps of the cat, so as to allow it to jump onto roofs as well as avoid ‘enemies’. If the cat misses a roof/falls into a gap between buildings/runs into an enemy, the game ends. The cat may also run into ‘power icons’ that aid in better facilitating its performance for a short period of time.
